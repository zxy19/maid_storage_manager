These are calculated based on the maid's memory. This also means that if an item is not in the maid's memory, or if some items in the memory do not exist, the craft may fail.

The four modes of storage definitions are essentially modifications to the maid's intended storage list. $(li) add adds the marked location to the list $(li) remove removes the marked location from the list $(li) replace removes all locations from the list first, then adds the marked location $(li) replace specify removes the same storage as the marked location's location from the list, then adds the marked location $(br2) If the maid holds multiple storage definitions, the maid will perform the above operations in order of the storage definitions (the storage definition on the request list takes effect last).",
